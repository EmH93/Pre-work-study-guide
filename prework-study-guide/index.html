        <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
        <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
        <li> Colours can be added as hex codes or standard references such as blue or yellow.</li>
        <li> by linking the CSS file in the head section of the HTML we can effectively keep the files separate.</li>

      <ul>
        <li>Before pushing your changes to the main branch always pull the main branch in to check for changes - do this with git pull origin main.</li>
        <li>Push your changes to the main branch with git push origin "branch name".</li>
        <li>Always create a separate branch for any new feature or amend. </li>

      <h2> JavaScript</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Javascript uses code flow to execute code, as a result code is actioned in order, so code needs to be added in logically.</li>
        <li>Variables are containers for information in Javascript.</li>
        <li>For loops can be used (as an example) to run through a numerical list in order, without needing to type code for each number.</li>
        <li>Functions allow you to action a chunk of code at once with a function call, saving you from typing out all the code each time.</li>
