        <li> Colours can be added as hex codes or standard references such as blue or yellow.</li>
        <li> by linking the CSS file in the head section of the HTML we can effectively keep the files separate.</li>

        <li>Before pushing your changes to the main branch always pull the main branch in to check for changes - do this with git pull origin main.</li>
        <li>Push your changes to the main branch with git push origin "branch name".</li>
        <li>Always create a separate branch for any new feature or amend. </li>

      <h2> JavaScript</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Javascript code is read in order - this is known as the code flow.</li>
        <li>Because of code flow, functions/variables/the code should be written in order to work effectively.</li>
        <li>A variable is a container for data / information </li>
        <li>A for loop can help run the code through (for example) a numerical list without needing to type each number out in it's own line of code.</li>
        <li>A function can package up a section of code, which allows you to action that whole chunk just by calling the function.</li>
