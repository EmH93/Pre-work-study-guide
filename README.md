# Pre-work-study-guide

## Description


This is my prework study guide which I have built as part of the pre-work for a front end development bootcamp. Importantly it has helped me get stuck in with working in Github and working with CSS and Javascript for the first time, as well as improving my knowledge of HTML. This study guide contains some of my notes from the pre work modules, to help me revise when necessary.

## Usage

Within this study guide you can view the various sections - HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript, and view my notes on each segment.
Also by opening the DevTools Console, you can see JavaScript running, it will list the topics covered in the prework and suggest which topic we should look at first.
